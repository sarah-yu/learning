# Learning Vue - Simple To Do List

A simple to do list app built using Vue.js, following [this tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-to-do-app-with-vue-js-2).

This app also uses [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) and [SweetAlert](https://sweetalert.js.org/).


## Why did I choose Vue.js?

I chose to learn Vue.js because according to [The State of JavaScript 2017](https://stateofjs.com/), Vue.js is catching up to React in terms of popularity.


## What problem does Vue.js solve?

Vue.js is a flexible and approachable framework for building user interfaces, and it was designed to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. It can be used as a web application framework or be used to power simple single-page applications. (https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)


## What is the history of Vue.js?

Vue.js was created by ex-Google employee Evan You. It was released in February 2014. It is an MIT License Open Source Project.


## My Thoughts

So far, Vue.js seems pretty fun to use and easier to grasp compared to React. Vue.js also uses components and props, so my understanding of React definitely helped me learn Vue.js. The components are structured differently and is taking some time to get used to. Vue.js also uses directives, which are some special token in the markup that tells the library to do something to a DOM element. This was new to me as it does not exist in React.
